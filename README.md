I'll be using this page as my [ELN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_lab_notebook). Feel free to add comments and suggest improvements!

Due to the increasing number of chemicals being restricted for the amateur experimenter, I'll try to focus on making basic reagents that are difficult to acquire, and investigate replacing those hard-to-get chemicals in well known reactions. I also have an interest in flavorings, so you'll see me making a few of those here as well. Plus whatever just happens to catch my interest at any given time.
