# Hydrobromic Acid
__Status:__ ![#C24F3D](https://via.placeholder.com/15/C24F3D/000000?text=+) Failure
## Goal
Making 48 % hydrobromic acid from potassium bromide and potassium hydrogensulfate. Usually dilute sulfuric acid is added to potassium bromide in water<sup>1</sup>, but due to the upcoming sulfuric acid ban in the EU, it should be investigated whether freely available potassium hydrogensulfate is a suitable substitute for sulfuric acid.


## To-Do
none


## Theory
KHSO<sub>4</sub> is a weak acid, meaning it only partially dissociates in water. However, HBr is a gas, so by distilling off HBr as it is formed it might be possible to shift the equilibrium of HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> to the right and yield some hydrobromic acid.

KHSO<sub>4</sub> + KBr → K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + HBr

## Experimental
In a 100 mL RBF 20 mL water were added to a mixture of KBr (11.90 g, 100 mmol, 1 eq.) and KHSO<sub>4</sub> (14.65 g, 93 %, 100 mmol, 1 eq.), which cooled down considerably during dissolution. It was then set up for distillation, and upon heating the water took on a slight yellow color. After 10 mL of water had passed the mixture looked quite orange, followed shortly by the appearance of crystals in the mixture. After approx. 12 mL had passed the head temperature began rising above 100 °C and the mixture began to bump. The temperature rose up to 123 °C when the distillation was aborted, as it became apparent only miniscule amounts of constant boiling aq. HBr were going to be generated. In the end the 18 mL that had been collected had a pH of approx. 2.


## Results
Potassium hydrogensulfate proved unsatisfactory for the preparation of hydrobromic acid. A small amount was produced, but was irrelevant at this scale, as only approx. 2 mL of water remained in the flask that might have provided constant boiling HBr - a significant amount of which would have been held up in the apparatus.
